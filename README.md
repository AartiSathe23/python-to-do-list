Python Tkinter To-Do List with User Authentication

This repository contains a To-Do List application developed using Python and Tkinter. The To-Do List features user authentication, allowing users to sign up for an account or log in to their existing account. Users can then add tasks, mark tasks as done, delete tasks, or exit the application. The data is stored in a database, ensuring that tasks are saved securely and persistently across sessions.

Add tasks: Users can add new tasks to their To-Do List.
Mark tasks as done: Users can mark tasks as completed once they are finished.
Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from their To-Do List.
Clean and intuitive user interface designed with Tkinter.
